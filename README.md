# modern_reinforcement_learning_course
My solutions repository for DRL exercises.
The exercises consists on personal implementations of methods proposed directly from the papers. 
These implementations are part of the course Modern Reinforcement Learning (https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-q-learning-from-paper-to-code).

The algorithms implemented are:
  - Q-Learning
  - Deep Q-Learning (DQN) (Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning." Nature 518.7540 (2015): 529-533)
  - Double DQN (Van Hasselt, Hado, Arthur Guez, and David Silver. "Deep reinforcement learning with double q-learning." Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence. Vol. 30. No. 1. 2016)
  - Dueling DQN (Wang, Ziyu, et al. "Dueling network architectures for deep reinforcement learning." International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2016)
  - Dueling Double DQN (Combinations of modifications of the two papers cited before)
  - Policy Gradient
